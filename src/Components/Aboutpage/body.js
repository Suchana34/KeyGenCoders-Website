            Started in 2015 as a Facebook page, KeyGEnCoders kicked off as a
            group to help students venture further into the fields of
            Competitive programming and later pivoted to a full-fledged club
            that brought together KGECians to learn Web Development, Data
            Science, Android Development and share their learnings with
            juniors/peers. Till date, with more than 20+ members, the group
            continues to fulfil it's mission of making CS fun and easy to learn
            for all by organizing classes and competitions regularly.
